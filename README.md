Tasks
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

///1 - multiply/divide/subtract/add - all of which will all be a function

2 - create a function called operate - it will take an operator and 2 numbers that will call one of the functions above

3 - create a simple HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the operators and an equals button

4 - add a clearAll button that would clear out the display for the calculator, basically resetting the calculator

6 - create a display function that will update the display once the number buttons are clicked, and store the display value to a variable for later uses

7 - You should save the first input to a variable, and save the operator the user clicks, and then we use operate() on them when the uses presses =

My planning:

the eqaul button should run only if we have 2 numbers and an operator

the equal button on click would run the operate() function, in which it would take 2 numbers and an operator to compute



When I click on 7 it will change the value of x to 7, it will keep adding more numbers to it as long as I didnt click onto an operator

Once the operator is click, the number thereafter will change y, and only once we click equal will it compute



create a function that would figure out which input x or y is currently being edited
getCurrent()
